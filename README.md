# XXY-Advanced-Dashboard
Contain my learning and reflections on advanced dashboard projects

Tried Serveral approach to create interactive dashboardd, which allow user to:
   
   1. Send dynamic and auto generated email from the dashboard
   2. Put notes and documentations into the dashboard
   3. download the data in csv, pdf, even in PPT :)

Plan to try three different method, which will be open source:

   1. Python Flask, react app
   2. R Shiny app
   3. Power App

All of those methods will be integrated into most used dashboard tool (Tableau and PowerBI)
